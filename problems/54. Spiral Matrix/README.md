# [54. Spiral Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/)

To solve this problem, we will simulate the process of traversing the matrix in a spiral order. We will keep track of the boundaries of the matrix and the direction in which we are moving. We will move in the direction until we reach the boundary, then we will change the direction and update the boundary accordingly.
